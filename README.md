# wireguard-kit

## Introduction

WireGuard follows the Unix philosophy of doing one thing and doing it well.  It is not a complete production VPN solution.  

wireguard-kit extends WireGuard into a complete production VPN solution.

## Client and server

WireGuard itself is a peer to peer technology.

wireguard-kit configures one computer as a server and the rest as clients.
The clients have only a WireGuard connection to the server and connect to other clients via the server.

The server has:
- A WireGuard configuration stanza for each client
- An active clients log
- Optionally a firewall to separate client subnets

## Tested versions

wireguard-kit server:
- was tested on Debian Bullseye
- may work on Debian derivatives including Ubuntu and its derivatives

Client configurations generated by wireguard-kit:
- were tested on:
  - Debian Buster and Bullseye clients
  - macOS 13 Ventura
  - Windows 10
- are expected to work on all clients listed at https://www.wireguard.com/install including:
  - Android
  - iOS
  - Linux 
  - macOS
  - OpenWRT
  - Windows

## wireguard-kit components

For use on the server:
- to create WireGuard clients, a script to:
  - generate, for a new client, the client and server configuration stanzas
  - effect the server configuration stanza
  - optionally to install on ssh-accessible Linux clients: WireGuard, the client configuration stanza and a systemd service to restart WireGuard on loss of connection
- for logging current clients:
  - a script to generate log messages
  - wireguard-logger.service and timer to run the script
  - an example crontab line to use instead of the above service and timer
  - a logrotate configuration file to rotate the log
- to synchronise the WireGuard server configuration to a standby server:
  - a script to do the synchronisation
  - sync_wireguard_to_standby.service and timer to run the script
  - an example crontab line to use instead of the above service and timer
- a logcheck filters file
